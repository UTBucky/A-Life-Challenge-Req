# Artificial Life Simulator

This project is a Python-based artificial life simulator that models an evolving ecosystem populated by digital organisms. Each organism is driven by a genome that defines traits such as speed, vision, attack, defense, and reproductive strategy. Over time, natural selection and mutation create emergent behaviors, population dynamics, and evolutionary trends.

## Features

- **Organism Genetics:** Each organism has a unique genome controlling traits like:
  - Species
  - Size, Speed, Camouflage, Defense, Attack
  - Vision range
  - Metabolism rate, Nutrient efficiency, Diet type
  - Reproduction method, Fertility, Offspring count
  - Movement ability: Swim, Walk, Fly

- **Ecosystem Simulation:**
  - Dynamic environment using NumPy arrays
  - Organisms consume, reproduce, mutate, and die

- **Reproduction & Mutation:**
  - Asexual or sexual reproduction
  - Mutations introduce variability to genome traits
  - Genome constraints enforce realistic evolution

- **Visualization:**
  - 2D simulation rendered using Pygame
  - Color-coded organism types and behavior indicators
  - Real-time stats and simulation controls

## ðŸ§  Technologies

- Python
- Pygame (2D rendering)
- NumPy (efficient matrix handling)
- Object-oriented design for modular components
